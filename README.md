# Mission-to-Mars
This was my first experience working in html. This repository contains the scrapping.py, app.py and index.html files for the Mission-to-Mars web scraping exercise utilizing  python, jupyter notebook, and mongodb.  I used Flask, Splinter, Python, and Beautiful Soup to create a webscraping app, which then stored the information/documents in a non-relational database (mongodb).  For the site, I utilized the Bootstrap library, as well as basic html and css formatting and populated it with the scraped data from my local mongodb database. 

In addition to the base requirements, I added additional functionality to the site including but not limited to:

* updated the scraped sites to find the most recent images from the mars perseverance rover and the mars reconnaissance orbiter
* included the most up to date mars news scraped from nasa.gov with hyperlink
* included section for scraped mars weather 
* modified the scraping button to be stylized with a "launch!" theme
* added a background image to the jumbotron 
* formatted the overall site for a dark background with light text
* included hyperlinks for most of the images to show full size/frame in the browser when clicked
* utilized bootstrap formatting to make the site adaptable for different sized viewing devices
* thumbnailed the 4 mars hemisphere images and linked to their full size/frame images
