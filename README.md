# Mission-to-Mars
This was my first experience working in html. This repository contains the scrapping.py, app.py and index.html files for the Mission-to-Mars web scraping excercise utlizing python, jupyter notenbook, and mongodb.  I utilized Flask and python for to create a webscraping app. For the site, I utilized the Bootstrap library, as well as basic Html and css formatting. 

In addition to the base requirements, I added additional functionality to the site including:

* updated the scraped sites to find the most recent images from the mars perserverance rover and the mars reconissance orbiter
* included the most up to date mars news scraped from nasa.gov with hyperlink
* included section for scraped mars weather 
* modified the scraping button to be stylized with a "launch!" theme
* added a background image to the jumbotron 
* formatted the overall site for a dark backround with light text
* mincluded hyperlinks for most of the images to show full size/frame in the browser
* utilized bootstrap to make the site adaptable for different sized viewing devices
* thumbnailed the 4 mars hemisphere images and linked ot their full size/frame images
